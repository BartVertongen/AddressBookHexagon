PERFECT CODE: PROJECT: Write a Digital AdressBook.
===================================================
===================================================	

LESSON2: Analyses
====================
Why do we need to Analyse ?
- To know what the client wants.
- To know the behavior of the software/system.
- To know how much time it will take to develop.



	
User Stories versus Use Cases
--------------------------------
Start with the Minimal Viable Product.

A UserSory is about the needs of the Actors (users, system, administrator)
Actor wants/needs .... so/because..(goal/extra value)...

Identify the Nouns and verbs from the user stories.

Use Cases are about behavior and interaction(methods of classes)
Use Cases describe the interaction between Actor and the System.
Use Cases have a beginpoint and an endpoint.
Between the beginpoint andendpoint there can be other interactions.
Use Cases have precondition, postcondition, needed events, steps and other paths.

Use Cases have:
- Actor
- System
- Goal
Option:
- Stackholder
- Precondition
- Triggers

Use Cases should not worry about user interfaces.
Use cases can not have more than 10 steps.
You can use use cases in use cases.
Do not use if or else in use cases
Do not use goto in use cases.

First you write the Main Cases (positive ones)
Then you write the extensions (negative ones like invalid input)


LESSON2 TASK 1 : Analyse quickly in less than 15 minutes.
=============================================================
Minimal Viable Product
-----------------------
Get the nouns and verbs.

Understanding:
	Business Rules; Logic
	Minimal Product to be usefull.
	
An Adress Book is a collection of Contacts.

A contact has :
- Name			Can Not Be Empty
- Street
- PostalCode
- Town
- Phone			
- Email

Phone or Email should have a Value.
Street, PostCode, Town should all have a value or None of them. (WHY?)


Extended Product.
--------------------
- FirstName
- MiddelName
- LastName

- ContactType (Personal or Business)
- CompanyName
- Function


- Street
- StreetNumber
- Box
- Town
- District
- SubDistrict
- Province
- Country


LESSON 2 TASK4: Estimate How Much Time Needed To Build The System in Man Hours.
================================================================================
Try 1 estimate by Class
1) AdressBook
2) Contact
3) UseCase1_1
4) UseCase1_2
5) UseCase1_3A
6) UseCase1_3B
7) UseCase2_1
8) UseCase2_2
9) UseCase2_3

9 classes => 900 lines of code => 900x 8 = 7.200 Euro or 9 days work

Try 2 estimate by UseCase Steps
UseCase1_1 	=> 2 steps
UseCase1_2 	=> 2 steps
UseCase1_3A 	=> 2 steps
UseCase1_3B 	=> 2 steps
UseCase2_1	=> 11 steps
UseCase2_2	=> 12 steps
UseCase2_3	=> 4 steps
----------------------------------
		  35 steps => 200€ per step = 7.000€ per step 
		The price of a step are based on the price per classes.
This is a rough estimation.

THERE IS NO GARRANTY THAT THE ESTIMATION IS CORRECT.


Task 5: Start Coding the UseCases
==================================
To make code is to test just start with writing tests.
Rank all the solutions of students from badest to best solution.
