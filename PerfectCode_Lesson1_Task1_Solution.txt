Differences:
- 1 big sprint against many sprints.
- One big meeting and agreement against a lot of meetings.
- Changing requirements is a big problem against changing requirements regulary.
- Every step is done once against every step is done multiple times.
- Adaptions are a problem against adaptions are part of the process.
- Most communication at the start against communication all the time
