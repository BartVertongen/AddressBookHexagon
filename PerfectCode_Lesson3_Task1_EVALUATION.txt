LESSON 3 TASK 1: EVALUATION OF THE RESULT.
==========================================
==========================================

Rewrite the code from lesson2.
==================================
- Split the code in 3 layers.(Done)

- Add Unit Testing on the level of classes.(Done)

- Find a way to test the Use Cases as close as possible to the original Use Cases.



IS IT PERFECT SOFTWARE ?
===========================
PROs
----------
1) Testable:
    - The Code is testable because it is tested by mimicing the Use Cases with Unit Testing.
    - We also have Unit Test on Class Level.
    - The UseCase implemented as a Console Application is near the real UseCases.
            there is interaction between USER and SYSTEM.

2) Documentation:
    - The Test are also a kind of Documentation.
    - There are Comments to explain the code.

3) Platform Independant:
    - The code is platform Independant because it is written in C#.NET Core.

4) We used Design Patterns --> Adapter.

5) Architecture:
    - We used a MultiLayer Architecture and there is a clear separation between the 
            Business and Data layer.

6) Interfaces (SOLID):
    We used Interfaces which is part of the SOLID principle.


CONs
----------
1) Testable and Analysis.
    - The UseCase implementated as a Console Application can not be automated.
    - We can not try them with different input.
    - They are not really tests but just implementations of the UseCase.

2) Architecture:
    - The UI-layer is empty, so what is the purpose ?


3) ReUse -- Changes:
    - How easy is it to reuse this code ?
    - How easy is it to change this code ?
