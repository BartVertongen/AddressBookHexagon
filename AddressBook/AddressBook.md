# AddressBook Project

## User Stories

### Epic: Implement a digital Adress Book.

#### Feature A: The user should be able to consult the AdressBook
##### UserStory A1: Complete Overview
    A USER wants    
        An overview of all contact,      
        So he gets an idea how much contacts he has.    

##### UserStory A2: Filtered Overview
    A USER wants     
        a Filtered Overview of the Contacts,    
        So it becomes easier to find the right Contact. 

#### UserStory A3: Select a Contact
    A USER wants        
        To Select a Name in the list containing a certain string,
        So decide on which Contact the next operation will work.    
						
#### Feature B: The User should be able to Maintain the Contacts (update, delete or change Contacts--CRUD)
#### UserStory B1:
    A USER wants        
        To add a New Contact,      
        So he can use that data later when he needs it.     

#### UserStory B2:
    A USER wants        
        To change or extend the Data about a Contact,       
        So it stays updated.        

#### UserStory B3:
    A User wants        
        To delete an contact that is not used anymore,      
        So it does not find it again in the overview.
